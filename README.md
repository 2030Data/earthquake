The National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC) determines the location and size of all significant earthquakes that occur worldwide and disseminates this information immediately to national and international agencies, scientists, critical facilities, and the general public. The NEIC compiles and provides to scientists and to the public an extensive seismic database that serves as a foundation for scientific research through the operation of modern digital national and global seismograph networks and cooperative international agreements.
